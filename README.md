**Game of Life**
*in rust* 

-----------------

- Acts a little bit like a screen saver. Randomly generates patterns, and periodoically resets to a new random game of life after the previous game gets too messy.
- Can be run or built via 'cargo' '''cargo run''' or '''cargo build'''.
- Probably works on windows, but it has only been tested on linux.
